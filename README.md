# Eye-C-U
In this project we shall be demonstrating a potential application of machine vision, in this case detecting whether a person in an image is smiling. Unfortunately most hosting services do not allow the use of an external python script being ran on their server as it poses a potential threat to their customers. As such it would not be possible to view the full capabilities of the site published as is. 

However it is still possible to test the object detector individually. 

Firstly one would have to download the code from this github repository. 
Next install python and opencv, instructions here, https://www.python.org/downloads/ and https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

Next follow the instructions found in the comments found in the "main.py"
, it should already be setup for test as is.

This shows how the website would operate if fully functional.
